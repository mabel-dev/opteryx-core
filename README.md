## What is Opteryx?

Opteryx is a Python library enabling SQL queries across diverse data sources like Apache Iceberg, Postgres, Parquet, and MongoDB. Opteryx champions the SQL-on-everything approach, streamlining cross-platform data analytics by federating SQL queries across diverse data sources. The goal is to enhance your data analytics process by offering a unified way to access data from across your organization. Opteryx combines the simplicity of SQLite and DuckDB with federated query capabilities found in Presto and Trino.

Opteryx offers the following features:
